            Like every other fresh summer morning, the town glowed bright yellow light through the calm streets rousing gently the lads who had to march down to work. The morning sun was always looked up for for it was the only desired weather of the day. Afternoons were too hot and the nights too cold. A streak of light passed through the louvered windows of the cafeteria close to which Lewis sat that morning with an empty mug in which the light fell. He was an old, partially blind, and a debile man. He clenched on the coffee mug, biting his lips nervously. He looked around to find only two others sitting near the waiter desk which made it all the more convenient for him. 

<br><br>Lewis had melancholia and all through his life he was alone and had nobody to be with. This time he had decided what he was going to do to keep himself happy. He was going to rob the cafeteria of all their money. 

<br><br>Every second that went felt heavy as Lewis had his mind running back and forth through this decision. He was too old and didn’t want to care about the consequences if he failed. 

<br><br>This was the perfect chance for him to move across to the waiter’s desk and pull out his weapon. He closed his thoughts for once and walked quick towards the desk with his mask on. 

<br><br>“Anybody move a muscle, I shoot NOW” 
<br><br>
The other two were a couple from the hills nearby. The female clasped the hands of her husband. As Lewis looked at them, she mumbled in tears “We have nothing”. Lewis didnt want to hurt them.
<br><br>
“Now you, get all the money you have in this cafeteria”
<br><br>
There were three waiters. Markus stood in the center. He was bright, tall and charismatic. He had noticed something fishy even when he had served the old man. But he remained calm.
<br><br>
As Markus examined the old man, Billy beside him opened every drawer in haste. Lewis pointed his gun towards Markus’s face as he heard the clattering of coins. 
<br><br>
He didnt like the way Markus saw him. 
<br><br>
“Billy here, will give you the cash. Every cent here. Will you drop your weapon now?”
<br><br>
“STOP TALKING”
<br><br>
“For an old man like you, the gun must be heavy. Let us handle this with the gun down”
<br><br>
“I’m NOT ol-” Lewis coughed violently as he screamed too much. He could feel his sore throat not letting him speak further. The air blew away the mask on his face and Markus could then find an old, wrinkled and tired face of Lewis. Lewis quickly put back the mask on.
<br><br>
Markus held a tissue in his hand for the old man. Lewis grabbed it and wiped his nose as he regained his position.
<br><br>
Lewis glanced at Markus’s face. Such a charismatic and young man working at a cafeteria; he probably could afford education for how rich he looked, and yet worked here.
<br><br>
“You, raise your hands” said Lewis as he pointed at Markus. 
<br><br>
“My hands are empty. You know I’m not going to hurt you. Neither is Billy beside me, nor is Stan”
<br><br>
The clattering continued and this time it was obvious that Billy was buying time.
<br><br>
“Where’s my money? QUICKER”
<br><br>
A neighbour had already seen what was happening inside through the glass panes and had telephoned the police.
<br><br>
The waiters faced towards the glass pane and could read the neighbour’s signal. Billy became nervous as to how he was going to buy more time.
<br><br>
“Can you hear some faded sirens? The police are arriving old man” said Markus as the clattering stopped and they all glared at each other in confusion. 
<br><br>
Lewis looked at Markus helplessly as Markus gazed into his eyes trying to read the old man. Markus slowly moved his eyes across the backdoor which was ajar, Lewis followed his eyes.
<br><br>
Through a distance blew sirens from two police vehicles as they stalled near the shade of the cafeteria. The officers stepped out from the vehicles with their pistols and moved swiftly towards the cafeteria. 
<br><br>
As they flung the front door open, with their pistols in their hands, they found the robber missing with all the money still on the front desk.
